I am grateful to my supervisor, Prof. Yannis Smaragdakis for giving me the chance to work on what i found interesting. His valuable insights and vast knowledge on the field of programming languages were crucial throughout the research for and writing of this thesis.

Of course, i would like to express my gratitude to EPFL PhD student Vlad Ureche whose expertise, guidance, and patience were decisive for this work. He has devoted a lot of hours to answer all of my questions, timely and consistently. I've learned a lot from him.

I would also like to thank all members of the PLAST group for their help, interest, and advice. Lastly, I
am deeply indebted to my parents for their support.
