This work describes the implementation of specific Scala collections operations
 using its recent compile-time metaprogramming capabilities.


In this work, we show that macros can help us create faster collections by
inlining operations at the call site. The project is based
on Paul Phillips's declosurify project (github.com/paulp/declosurify) and
modifies it to make the functionality available at the standard Scala library
level, so that all operations implemented with macros can be used on plain Scala
collection types (e.g., List, Array, etc.) without the need of creating new
specialized types. Wherever the macro expansion is not feasible or appropriate
we can fallback to the default ``normal'' implementation. The use of macros
here is not typical since they are used from inside the Scala Library where no
macro detection/expansion functionalities are directly available (the Scala
library doesn't depend on the Scala compiler or Scala reflect packages). The
results are encouraging since initial ScalaMeter benchmarks show a 30\% speedup.
