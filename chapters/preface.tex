This report is my master thesis for the conclusion of my postgraduate studies at the
Department of Informatics \& Telecommunications, University of Athens.
It was developed as a part of the MorphPL Project for the University of Athens, 
while conducting research with Prof.~Yannis Smaragdakis 
on compile-time metaprogramming techniques.

This work was implemented directly in the default Scala compiler and, using the new Scala compile-time reflection capabilities, we were able to improve the performance of a few common Scala standard library collections operations.\\
